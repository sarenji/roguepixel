Hello! I'm David Peter, and this was supposed to be my roguelike.

I have never played a roguelike before.

So consider this as just a fake roguelike programmed in less than 10k. This will be my submission for http://10k.aneventapart.com.

Now, of course, for it to be 10k, it's gotta be minified like heck. That's why I have this little git repository here -- well, that, and to back up my files.

Except I found I had no time, in between a two week Israel/Poland trip and deploying multiple websites, and misreading the deadline. Lesson learned.
